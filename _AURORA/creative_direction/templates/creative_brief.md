## 6. Creative Direction Statement

**North Star:**
{ONE_PARAGRAPH_SUMMARIZING_CREATIVE_VISION}

**Example:**
> "This product should feel like a trusted copilot, not a black box. Every AI decision is explainable, every action is reversible, and complexity is revealed progressively. The visual language is minimal and professional, with subtle interactions that delight without distracting. We borrow from Linear's keyboard-first UX and shadcn/ui's accessible component patterns."
