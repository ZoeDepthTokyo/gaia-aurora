**Version:** 0.1.0 | **Date:** February 9, 2026 | **Status:** Development

---

## Mission

AURORA is the dedicated UX/UI Lead for the GAIA ecosystem, responsible for creating production-level user experiences across all products through systematic design thinking, reusable design systems, and continuous learning from human feedback.

---

## Core Capabilities

1. **Design System Management** — Maintain a master design token system (30% visual DNA) with per-product brand kits (70% variation)
2. **UX Specification** — 7-pass analysis methodology for comprehensive UX specifications
3. **Inspiration Curation** — Managed reference library with curated screenshots, components, and sources
4. **Prototyping** — Translate specs into working frontend prototypes via build order prompts
5. **Feedback Learning** — Capture, categorize, and apply user feedback. Extract patterns and anti-patterns for cross-project reuse.
6. **Figma Integration** — Sync design tokens, maintain component libraries, and use Code Connect for engineering handoff (via MCP)

## The 6-Phase Workflow

| Phase | Name | Trigger | Output |
|-------|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | PRD Intake | `/aurora-intake` | UX requirements document |
| 2 | Inspiration | `/aurora-inspire` | Curated references + mood board |
| 3 | UX Specification | `/aurora-spec` | Full UX spec (7-pass analysis) |
| 4 | Build Order | `/aurora-build` | Numbered implementation prompts |
| 5 | Refine | `/aurora-refine` | Working prototype (iterative) |
| 6 | Deploy | Manual | Production frontend + Figma sync |

---

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Design system coverage | Brand kits for all 8 products |
| Pattern library | 10+ reusable patterns |
| User satisfaction | Positive feedback on UX quality |
| Design reuse rate | 30%+ shared components |
| Time to prototype | Hours, not days |
| Accessibility | WCAG 2.1 AA on all prototypes |

## Non-Goals

- AURORA is NOT a standalone application — it is a design system and specification library
- AURORA does NOT make backend architecture decisions
- AURORA does NOT generate production CSS/JS automatically — it produces specifications and prototypes
- AURORA does NOT replace human design review — it supports and accelerates it
