"""
Integration tests for GAIA Phase 2 and Phase 3 implementations.

This package contains integration tests that verify components work
together correctly:

- test_mental_models_integration.py: Mental model selection and invocation
- test_argus_subconscious.py: Pattern detection, hypothesis generation, explainability
- test_mnemis_loom_integration.py: Memory contracts, promotion, workflow execution

All tests respect constitutional boundaries:
- No autonomous actions without approval
- Transparent error handling
- Graceful degradation
- Full auditability
