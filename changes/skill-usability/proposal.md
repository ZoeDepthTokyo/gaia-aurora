# Proposal: GAIA Skill Usability System

**Problem**: GAIA has 15 skills but zero proactive surfacing. Skills are forgotten when most needed.
**Solution**: 3-pillar architecture — REDUCE (absorb 5 external skills), AUTOMATE (4 hook scripts), SURFACE (phase-aware listing + transparency audit).
**Result**: 15 -> 16 skills total; existing 15 get trigger keywords, phase tags, and "why" statements.
**Constitutional alignment**: Principle #6 (Governance at Design Time), #2 (HITL), #1 (Glass-box Transparency).
